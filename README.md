# Minesweeper

<h1>Gomo Minesweeper</h1>

<p>
  The second years at the University that I am going to were tasked with creating a minesweeper game.
  When I heard of this I decided to create my own Minesweeper game. My aim was to ensure that the 
  game is extensible. The life-cycle model I used for this game is Code-And-Fix.

  I intend to go over the design of this game and enhance it and use design patterns where
  necessary.
